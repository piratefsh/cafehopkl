                <img id="about-logo" src="img/cafehopkl_logo.png"/>
                <p>CafeHop KL is a mapping project mapping independent cafes around Kuala Lumpur. We have made this site and also printed copies to distribute among 28 cafes that have supported this project.
                <br/>
                Cafes are chosen based on a combination of good coffee, good food, good service and/or good vibes in general. So, what are you waiting for? Start cafe hopping, pop by these novel cafes and ﬁnd one that suits you. We hope you ﬁnd a nice place and have a great coffee.</p>

                            <span class="name">Joachim Leong</span> After visiting as many cafes possible around Malaysia, Joachim thought why not a cafe map for KL? If he was a coffee, he would be a macchiato just because itʼs not mainstream.

                            <span class="name">Jamie Lim</span> Bubbly, sporty Jamie is our wonder girl for graphics in CafeHop KL. If she isnʼt behind the computer, you can ﬁnd throwing a frisbee around KL. If Jamie was a coffee, she would be a latte - she ainʼt latte-ing you down! 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="name">Sher Minn Chong</span> Sher Minn, our webpage designer on the other side of the Atlantic but soon to return to Malaysia to conquer one webpage at a time! If Sher Minn was a coffee , she would be ʻcham coffeeʼ (tea mixed with local coffee) - drink hot coffee, drink hot tea, burn your lips, and youʼll remember her!
                        </li>
                        <li> <span class="name">Shean Tan</span> Shean is our ﬁlm-loving, ﬁlm-camera trotting photographer taking awesome hipster shots of cafes, latte art and coffee all around KL town. If Shean was a coffee, she would be an ice drip coffee because sheʼs deliberate, patient and well-measured.
