                <h1>About CafeHop KL</h1>
                <p>
                    CafeHop KL is a mapping project mapping independent cafes around Kuala Lumpur. We have made this site and also printed copies to distribute among 28 cafes that have supported this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cafes are chosen based on a combination of good coffee, good food, good service and/or good vibes in general. So, what are you waiting for? Start cafe hopping, pop by these novel cafes and ﬁnd one that suits you. We hope you ﬁnd a nice place and have a great coffee.
            </p>
                <h3>How we got here</h3>
                <p>
                    This started as a passion project to help connect cafes and coffee lovers in Malaysia. 

                    Originally, funding was sought via crowd-funding under <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kl-cafe-hopping-map-2013">Indiegogo</a> but failed spectacularly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Barista Guild Asia approached us to work with us in approaching independent cafes around KL and coffee organisation like Coffex, Dankoff, Auresso and Cuppa to help fund the costs of designing, printing and promoting this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, a total of 28 cafes out of the full list helped fund this map and are listed on the physical map which are now distributed in these cafes. Again, all cafes are vetted for good service, good coffee and good ambience and we hope you find a cafe that suits you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to thank these cafes and organisations for supporting, funding and believing in this project while respecting our creative and vetting independence in this project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The digital map will be updated in the beginning of each month for new cafes that are up to our standards. We hope for better and a more vibrant cafe culture in Malaysia. 
                </p>

                            <span class="name">Joachim Leong</span> After visiting as many cafes possible around Malaysia, Joachim thought why not a cafe map for KL? If he was a coffee, he would be a macchiato just because itʼs not mainstream. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="name">Jamie Lim</span> Bubbly, sporty Jamie is our wonder girl for graphics in CafeHop KL. If she isnʼt behind the computer, you can ﬁnd her throwing a frisbee around KL. If Jamie was a coffee, she would be a latte - she ainʼt latte-ing you down! 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="name">Sher Minn Chong</span> Sher Minn, our website designer on the other side of the Atlantic but soon to return to Malaysia to conquer one webpage at a time! If Sher Minn was a coffee , she would be a double espresso; a good representation of the amount of caffeine she consumes daily. 
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <span class="name">Shean Tan</span> Shean is our ﬁlm-loving, ﬁlm-camera trotting photographer taking awesome hipster shots of cafes, latte art and coffee all around KL town. If Shean was a coffee, she would be an ice drip coffee because sheʼs deliberate, patient and well-measured.
